animator = Animator(xlabel="epoch", xlim=[1, num_epochs], legend=["train loss", "train acc", "test acc"])
for epoch in range(1, num_epochs + 1):
    # Use a separate PRNG key to permute image data during shuffling
    rng, input_rng = jax.random.split(rng)
    # Run an optimization step over a training batch
    state = train_epoch(state, train_ds, batch_size, epoch, input_rng, animator)
    # Evaluate on the test set after each training epoch
    test_loss, test_accuracy = eval_model(state.params, test_ds)
    animator.add(epoch, (None, None, test_accuracy))
    print(" test epoch: %d, loss: %.2f, accuracy: %.2f" % (epoch, test_loss, test_accuracy * 100))
